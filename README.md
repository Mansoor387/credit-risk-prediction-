# Credit Risk Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to default on a loan based on demographic, financial, and loan-related features.
It uses **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **machine learning classification models** to make predictions.
Two models â€” **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree Classifier** â€” are trained and evaluated using **accuracy** and a **confusion matrix**.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset contains information such as:

* **Gender**, **Marital Status**, **Dependents**
* **Education Level**, **Self-Employment Status**
* **Applicant & Co-applicant Income**
* **Loan Amount**, **Loan Term**, **Credit History**
* **Property Area**
* **Loan Status** (Target variable: Y = Approved, N = Rejected)

## ðŸ›  Skills & Concepts Used

* Handling Missing Data
* Data Encoding for Categorical Variables
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
* Classification Models (**Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree**)
* Model Evaluation (Accuracy Score & Confusion Matrix)

## ðŸ“Š Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning** â€” Fill missing values using median/mode.
2. **EDA** â€” Visualize loan amounts, education levels, and applicant income distribution.
3. **Feature Encoding** â€” Convert categorical variables into numeric form.
4. **Model Training** â€” Train Logistic Regression & Decision Tree Classifier.
5. **Evaluation** â€” Compare model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.



## ðŸ“ˆ Results

* **Logistic Regression Accuracy:** \~78.8%
* **Decision Tree Accuracy:** \~69.1%
* Logistic Regression performed better for this dataset.
